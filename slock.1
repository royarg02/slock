To make sure a locked screen can not be bypassed by switching VTs
or killing the X server with Ctrl+Alt+Backspace, it is recommended
to disable both in
.Xr xorg.conf 5
for maximum security:
.Bd -literal -offset left
Section "ServerFlags"
	Option "DontVTSwitch" "True"
	Option "DontZap"      "True"
EndSection

.Sh CUSTOMIZATION
.Nm
can be customized by creating a custom config.h from config.def.h and

.Em Xresources
with
.Em slock
prefix. See the source code for which settings can be provided through this method.
